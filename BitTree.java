/**
 *   bit tree representation where each node is either a 0 or 1

 *             1
 *            / \
 *           1   0
 *          /\   /\
 *         1  1 0  1
 *
 *     the tree follow the rules:
 *     a. node is 1 only all the children are 1 else 0
 *     b. tree is a complete binary tree so can be represented as an array
 *        e.g. [1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
 *
 *     operations:
 *     1. update(index,length,0/1)
 *     2. getBit(index)
